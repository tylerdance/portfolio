                <p>After finishing 13 weeks of full time web development at General Assembly, Iâ€™ve learned what it means to develop a strong fullstack application. The majority of the program was focused on Javascript, so while that is what this portfolio currently reflects, I am excited to include a Python project here to better represent my current skill set.</p>
                <p>Each of the four projects that is presented on this portfolio was developed over the course of a week or two, each project building on the last as my knowledge of Javascript grew. Given the short time frame for production, I did not have the time to finish everything I hoped to accomplish on each project. I am currently in the process of going back over each project to make them responsive to screen size, implementing features that were left as stretch goals, and refactoring code to be more concise and legible.</p>
