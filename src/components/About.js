                <p>During a 13 week sprint of full time web development at General Assembly, I developed three fullstack applications using React,js, MongoDB, and Express, and one mini game using Javascript. The independent nature of the work was rewarding, but I ultimately got the most out of group projects. Now having a good understanding of what managing a project means as far as source control, merge conflicts, and pull requests, Iâ€™m looking forward to bringing this knowledge to my next software engineering role.</p>
                <p>This portfolio currently reflects entirely Javascript based projects, but I am currently developing some Python apps to better represent my current skill set. Each of the four projects that is presented on this portfolio was developed over the course of a week or two. Given the short time frame for production, I did not have the time to finish everything I hoped to accomplish on each project. I am currently going back over each project to implement features that were left as stretch goals such as screen size responsiveness, and refactoring code to be more concise and legible.</p>
