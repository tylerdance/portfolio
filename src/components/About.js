                {/* <p>During a 13 week sprint of full time software development at General Assembly, I developed three fullstack applications using React.js, MongoDB, SQL, Express, and Node, and one mini game in Javascript. Exposure to such a fast paced environment reassured me of my potential to learn new technologies quickly and effectively while maintaining an appetite for even more challenging problems. The independent nature of the work was rewarding, but I learned more from the group projects with small production teams. Now having a good understanding of project management in terms of source control, merge conflicts, and time management, Iâ€™m looking forward to bringing these skills to my next software engineering role.</p>

Users are able to view current leaderboards sorted by League Points, and will soon be able to also sort by win/loss ratio and search individual players for recent match history.
